The file OCT Project contains c# code of our application.
This code takes the OCT images - filter the images - extract the features by doing a vertical projection on the images which are the x,y coordinates that later have been applied to polynomial fitting, this equations describe the formation or deformation of the nerve fiber layer. The last phase is training and evaluation different machine learning models.
