# Task Folder Details

Note : Please Follow the below guidelines to create task folders
- Task Folder Naming Convention : _task-n-taskname.(n is the task number)_  ex: task-1-data-analysis, task-2-model-deployment etc.
- All Task folder names should be in chronologial order (from 1 to n)
- All Task folders should have a README.md file with task Details and task goals along with an info table containing all code/notebook files with their links and information
- Task folders that contain sub-tasks can create sub folders within the task.
- __Update the below table explaining the task details.__

### Task Table

| Task No| Task Name | Details |
|-|-|-|
|1|OCT Image preprocessing/Filtering|The dataset consists a train file with 1000. and 10 images for testing|
|2|OCT features (coefficient) extraction and selection / Polynomial Curve fitting|         |
|3|Machine Learning Modeling|Prepare/ Explore ML algorithm over extracted feature-Apply ML/DP models over the extracted features to find the highest accuracy model|
|4|         |         |
|5|Political Rationale| The entire basis of the political rationale is to create a document upon which we could use as a basis to know if the direction of our current application is viable or not|
